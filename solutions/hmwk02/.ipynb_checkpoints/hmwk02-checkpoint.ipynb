Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API please do not change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $40$, where squares $0$ and $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50, \\$100, or \\$200, or pay the bank \\$100 or \\$150.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 0, 10, and 20 do not trigger any action \n",
    "\n",

    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles she pays the bank \\$10 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank an amount equal to the square's number (e.g. if she lands on Square 29 she pays the bank \\$29). \n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",

It should take as arguments the player's current location on the board as well as the player's current cash reserves, and return the player's new location and cash reserves after the turn has completed. Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.  "

Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns.
