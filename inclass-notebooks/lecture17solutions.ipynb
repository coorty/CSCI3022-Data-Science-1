    "Graduate students in CU's little-known Parapsychology Department are conducting an experiment to test for clairvoyant abilities in CU's undergraduate population.  Their experiment involves drawing a card randomly from a standard deck, showing the student the back of the card, and asking them to predict whether the card is black or red. They repeat this test 100 times and record the number of cards that the student gets correct.  They've just finished testing a particularly enthusiastic student named Gandalf (his real name is Lawrence, but he insists that people call him Gandalf) who is quite adamant that he has psychic abilities. \n",
