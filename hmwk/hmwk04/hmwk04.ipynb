If the average is below 90 Freshies, the bale of hay must be thrown away, rejected.

    "[Plinko](http://priceisright.wikia.com/wiki/Plinko), the shining jewel of the gameshow [Price is Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right), is a staple of American culture.  Luckily for us, it's also chalk-full of interesting ideas from probability and statistics.

Players get to drop some number of discs down the Plinko board and keep their winnings.   \n",
