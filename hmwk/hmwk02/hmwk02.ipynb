Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API please do not change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

In a penalty shootout, each team takes turns attempting 5 shots on the goal from the penalty mark that are defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper, with the team that makes more successful kicks being declared the winner of the match.

    "In every homework assignment we'll give you a Challenge Problem.  Challenge Problems never need to be turned in (and in fact, will not be graded) but we encourage you to give them a shot (after completing the required homework problems) and discuss them with your classmates and your instructors. \n",

    "The following Challenge Problem was a [Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) a few years back. \n",

    "You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
